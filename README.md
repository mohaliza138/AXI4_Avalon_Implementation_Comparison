# AXI4 and Avalon Protocol Comparison

## üí° Overview
This project implements both AXI4 and Avalon protocols, including different variations of each standard, and compares the performance among these protocols.

## üîç Implemented Features
- **Avalon Protocol:**
  - **Avalon Stream**

    A protocol for high-speed data transfer without requiring memory-mapped addressing.
    This protocol only supports one-way data transform.

  - **Avalon Memory-Mapped**

    A protocol for connecting masters and slaves with memory-mapped transactions.
- **AXI4 Protocol:**
  - **AXI4 Lite**

    A simplified version of AXI4 for low-bandwidth memory-mapped communication.

  - **AXI4 Standard**

    A full-featured memory-mapped protocol supporting burst transactions.

  - **AXI4 Stream**

    A protocol designed for high-speed streaming of data without memory-mapped addressing.
